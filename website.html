                <h3>my overall goal for this website was to create layouts that centered a handmade aesthetic to communicate originality, craft & artistic expression</h3>

                <p>On the home page, I created a landing spot that was rich with collaged imagery, bringing together an eclectic collection of illustrations & photography cutouts, multiple brand colors, textural effects & dense image placement contrasted with white space to immediately let the viewer know they are in an artistic, creative place. Simple, straightforward navigation options are represented in the navigation header and the four large section blocks down the page.</p>

                <p>A prominent bright white background block highlights the email communications sign up function, which is present above the footer on almost every page and sub-page. Building a subscriber list would be an important part of the marketing efforts for a small, artisan business in building their wider audience of supporters in addition to their base of customers.</p>

                <p>The creamery page is the site's online shop - utilizing a non-standard, whimsical layout of the individual items to break away from a more traditional rigid grid. Feedback from project advisors led me to push and enhance the visual divisions between the product lines for better user experience and clarity. A small about section has a place on this product hub page, which likely would be a high-traffic spot for this website.</p>

                <p>Linking from here to an individual product page is how the user enters a sales flow, so this page holds all product details, description of purchasing options, and cross-links to recipes that include this product in the recipe journal blog page of this website. Feedback from advisor Janell led me to add product specs and information - an element that can contribute to increased conversions from an e-commerce lens. My conversation with Ian and Nicole led me to reconsider how I was mocking up the shopping cart and overall business model for the goat cheese products themselves, and to envision a pop-up model of selling at farmers markets, at partner businesses in the community like breweries, wineries, and other community events.</p>

                <p>Clicking into the celebrations page, the viewer finds the hub of information for private events and particularly weddings at the farm's barn event space - loaded with mini-photo galleries so that users can flip through images by hand as they actively explore the content. This landing page introduces the viewer to different uses of the space, a section introducing the farm-to-table culinary program & kitchen for events onsite, and importantly houses an inquiry form directly on the page, front and center. Generating inquiry leads would be a primary function for this website in supporting this artisan business' success, and the form gathers just the key pieces of information without being overwhelmingly long or over-specific so that users find it easy to inquire, and then the person-to-person follow-up would provide the hospitality and expertise to drive lucrative event bookings.</p>

                <p>In addition to private event bookings, this farm would also be an event space for community events, classes & seasonal markets, all open to the public - the community tab holds all of these events in blog format, as well as provides a hub of calendar & location information around community pop-ups and places to pick up pre-ordered product.</p>

            <div class="copy">
                <p>The journal tab is the recipe journal section of this website. Sharing recipes is a key marketing strategy for this business to stay in front of their audience and forms the heart of regular email communications to their audience. Rather than simply a “buy this” message, sharing recipes is way to show how to be creative and have fun with the product, and to offer ideas that refer directly back to this farm business and other partner businesses and collaborators in the local community.</P>

                <p>The recipe journal landing page holds highlighted, recent entries, and a link to the full, search-able journal archive. Individual journal entry pages are designed to present contents in a bespoke, charmingly cottage-core style as well as highlighting products and cross-linking to their individual product pages to capture opportunities for product sales.</p>
