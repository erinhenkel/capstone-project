                <h2>project summary & key takeaways</h2>

                <p>my work on chive blossom creamery & farm has been a unique experience for me to design in an aesthetically focused way - as opposed to an efficiency focused way, which is how i would likely describe the majority of my professional work over the last two decades. whether i've been in-house or freelance, there has been more of an emphasis on designing as well as i can but quickly, so that time resources are preserved and client budgets are kept as low as possible. this project work allowed me to really get free with my designing, to play with visuals and iterations, to pull in collage which is a big part of my own artistic practice in the painting studio, and to unleash my own artistic preferences instead of tailoring my work to a client's preferences. truly, i enjoy and have a solid set of skills in collaborating with clients and business owners - but this was a really great opportunity here in my capstone to be both the client making the final artistic decisions as well as the designer.</p>

                <p>if i had to identify my biggest challenge, it has been time and creative energy management. working an energetically demanding full-time graphic design job while tackling my masters degree made me absolutely yearn for my undergrad days, where i did have a side-job of course, but much more daily schedule free to go deep into school projects. many nights, i had the time possibly, but not the creative energy left. there are myriad additional elements that i would have liked to tackle - from additional pages and flows on my website designs, to actually bringing the website to life in code, to additional branding assets - the list goes on. in the end, it was important for me to narrow the scope in order to accomplish the cohesive project that i hope i did complete here.</p>
                    
                <p>my biggest successes here in chive blossom creamery & farm are related to artistic expression - i really feel like i got to integrate my own, unique artistry into these designs, and i'm really proud of that. i plan to take that into future work, hopefully connecting more and more with artisan businesses for project work and creative opportunities to collaborate and make the world a little better by supporting small businesses, bring art and creativity into life in my community, and make a stand for the original, the hand made, and the human to human connection that naturally comes along with craft.</p>
