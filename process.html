                <h2>design studio - branding & package design project</h2>

                <p>this capstone project started back in 2022 in the design studio course, with a brand identity & packaging focused studio project for my imagined goat cheese business. i created the initial branding & visual identity including the logo, color palette, typography, and curated imagery, patterns & illustration - and applied it to a boutique package design collection.</p>

                <h2>experimental interaction - brand refresh & exploration</h2>

                <p>i picked up the designs again after a year on the shelf for last semester's dynamic identities project, which was in the end essentially an incubator for refining multiple aspects of the visual identity. it's not every day that a designer can revisit concepts over multiple points in time, so this project work was a great opportunity to reflection my designs and refresh, refine, and integrate strategic improvements.</p>

                <h2>finalizing the visual identity & developing creative for the website design for chive blossom creamery & farm</h2>

                <p>one last time to dive back into this long form design project! my capstone project focuses on creating website design boards for this imagined small artisan business - as it expands to include an event & wedding venue along with a community event space - and continues to refine towards the goal of a visual identity that communicates that this business is artisan, authentic, creative & community engaged.</p>

                <h2>resources & research</h2>

                <p>i started with pulling together past work with initial research on inspiration for brand refinement and website design best practices -- for artisan maker-type businesses and also for events and wedding venues that are similar to my concept business.</p>

                <p>additional research topics that informed this project included exploring the craft & independent makers industry more generally, gathering some general economic information about artisan businesses, and some info that touched on the psychological wellbeing of being creative and producing objects by hand.</p>
                    
                <p>i was heavily inspired by a few wonderful examples out there: laclare creamery, vermont creamery, cypress grove for the goat cheese businesses, and pippin hill farm in virginia, olympia's valley organic farmstead & event venue in california, and bella luna farm in washington for the event venues.</p>

                <h2>polishing & expanding the brand</h2>

                <p>from logo versions, typography & color palette options, to graphic assets & illustrations needed to achieve a collage approach - refinements on all aspects of the brand elements fed into the website layouts as well as into supplemental pieces of collateral that would make sense for this business - signage design for farmer's market or pop-up, email newsletters for marketing communication and for building & engaging supporters and the wider community.</p>

                <p>updated branding also meant re-visiting my package designs from a couple years ago and making updates, as well as adding a set of “label-style” design for a secondary product line.</p>

                <p>content planning, prototypes in low, medium and finally high resolution followed for the website designs, utilizing figma to build out my layouts and interactions.</p>

                <p>the design process started with lo-fi wireframes in a mobile view - sorting out the basic areas of content for this site to cover all the aspects of the business in a simple layout.<p>
                    
                <p>from there, i pivoted to planning, iterating & experimenting with layout and content organization in a desktop view in figma, and continued to build out the key pages for design that cover the key functionality to make the site successful.</p>
